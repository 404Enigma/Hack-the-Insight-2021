<h2>The Problem it Solves</h2>
<p>As a convention, when individuals present their questions to the organizations it requires a few days for the organization to return to those clients,
Some of the time we can likewise see that equivalent sort of questions are asked by 1000s of clients, which makes it much more trying for the organization to deal with them.
So we have thought of a stage which uses AI and profound figuring out how to react to questions of clients for the benefit of the organization.</p>
<p>Essentially the model gains from the past reactions given to the client inquiries by the organization. From that it learns the answer for general issues looked by the clients. For security estimates we have added a certainty score, assuming that it is under a specific level like 30%.
We can inform the organizations about such questions. Furthermore every other inquiry will be dealt with by our platform.</p>

<h2>Challenges we Ran Into</h2>
<p>
Integrating a model into a website or an app was a bit difficult for the team. Having written down the algorithm in python, we were able to create an API of the same which we used in our website.
